# Audio-Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform audio classification using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze audio files, extract relevant features (such as MFCCs), and classify the sounds into predefined categories. The primary work is contained in a Jupyter Notebook, where the complete workflow—from data preprocessing to model evaluation—is implemented.

### Features
- **Audio Feature Extraction:** Extracts features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from audio files.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes normalization, feature scaling, and splitting of data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** Implements machine learning models for classification (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks, etc.).
- **Evaluation:** Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** Provides plots for feature distributions and performance metrics to help interpret results.
